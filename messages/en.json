      "p1": "Adoption is the formal, permanent transfer of parental rights to a family other than a child’s own and the formal assumption by that family of all parenting duties for the child. In some Islamic countries; including Egypt, the term ‘Kafala’ of Islamic law is used to describe a situation similar to adoption, but not necessarily with the transference of inheritance rights, or the change of the child’s full name.",
      "p2": "Despite Kafala being strongly encouraged in Islam there have been a misleading CULTURAL perception about its true meaning, practice, and significance. As a result, our innocent children have been under institutionalized care of orphanages rather than being granted a warm family life and home. We created this page to restore back the authentic meaning of Kafala in Islam that was taught by our beloved prophet."

      "list": {
        "listTitle": "Some of the essential phrases contained in this hadith are:",
        "listItem1": "The meaning of this hadith: the person who sponsors the orphans worldly concerns will occupy a high position in the heaven close to the position of the Prophet sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam [1] .",
        "listItem2": "The meaning of “caring for the orphans” is to take care of and support all their worldly interests, such as feeding (food and drink), clothing, nurturing and guiding them with proper Islamic education. [2]",
        "listItem3": "The meaning of an orphan is a person who has lost his father or both his parents before the age of maturity. [3]",
        "listItem4": "The virtue in this hadith applies to the person who sponsors the orphans from his own property or the orphan’s property if the person is truly the one to whom he is sponsored. [4]",
        "listItem5": "Similarly, this excellence applies to people who sponsor an orphan having kin relationship with him or with an orphan who has no kinship ties with them. [5]"

        "listItem3": "Adopted children are not entitled to the inheritance of the parents who nurtured them, in contrast to the customs of the time of Jahiliyyah who regarded adopted children as biological children who were entitled to inheritance when their adoptive parents died. [6]",
        "listItem4": "Adopted child is not a mahram [7] , so it is obligatory for parents who nurture him/her and their children to wear a hijab in front of the adoption, as when they are in front of other non-mahram. This is contrary to the customs in the time of Jahiliyyah."
